        <h2>My Reflections So Far</h2>

        <p>
        What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience? <br>
        I think that as with any experience, you get out what you put in. Like Shereef said, we're working in the kitchens, we're all in the trenches together struggling to gain a foothold and eventually push forward as one. The more we use each other's skills the more we all gain.
        </p>

        <p>
        What are your impressions? <br>
        Coming from a background where the traditional university experience hasn't aligned with my style of learning I can fully appreciate what EDA is trying to do. So far it feels like I've walked into a nice warm room with soft background music and friendly faces. I like the vibe.
        </p>

        <p>
        How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? <br>
        As long as I have the dedication, self-discipline and time management I feel like the culture is one I can really get behind and become absorbed in.
        </p>

        <p>
        Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? <br>
        Does it make you nervous? My biggest weakness in personal and professional life (besides chocolate) is communication. Throughout my time at EDA good communication is going to be my number one goal. I guess I'm nervous I'll slip with this and let down the rest of the cohort.....but I'm excited to try!
