          <h3>Talking to Inanimate Objects</h3>
          <br>
          <h4>Not too long ago I couldn't drive a manual car</h4>
          <p>I'd driven autos my entire (relatively short) driving career and had never had any need to drive stick. That is until my flatmate broke his foot and needed to be driven to the hospital. The only car around was manual... Luckily Christchurch had an emergency room close by so with my heart racing and unclear instructions being uttered between his grunts of pain we somehow managed to shudder along the back roads and get him there in one piece. <br>
          A few months down the track, spurred on by that one experience, I decided it was time to buy a stick of my own. I was terrible, stalling at every possible opportunity I could. At one point on that first day I managed to stall at 3 consecutive stop lights on one of the busiest streets in town. My incredibly supportive (not) friends made me switch seats in embarrassment so the hundred other drivers I'd held up would stop blasting their horns. <br>
          I sat up that whole night reading how to use the clutch, how a flywheel works, what happens in the engine when certain gears are selected etc and watched several instructionary videos on how not to drive like an embarrassment. Feeling like a stick-shift god, I found a derelict back road and using all the knowledge I had absorbed the previous night... I just about destroyed the car from bunnyhopping so much... but I kept at it, and eventually (through a combination of verbal teaching, reading/watching and actual practise) I got it; and I can now safely say I am not an absolute menace on the roads anymore!</p>
          <h4>A different time I was thirsty</h4>
          <p>I was desperately parched, dry lips, sticky throat, the works. Beside me lay a drink bottle, empty and useless. Not even a drop to tantilize my tastebuds. However, I hunted round and with great effort eventually found a sink. Now this sink had unreasonably low taps, this drink bottle would never fit in there! After trying in vain (and looking like a right idiot) for far too long I realised that if I cupped my hand and formed a half tunnel shape I could redirect the water with my hand-chute into a space which would allow the bottle to fill up properly. By using what was around me, I quenched my thirst for water and for DIY ingenuity, feeling like a backyard inventor and learning that simple solutions are often rather elegant.</p>
          <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process':</h4>          
          <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode</li><p>Still learning how to describe each step properly and figuring out how many sub steps need to make up each bigger step to have a concise, but informative set of pseudocode.</p>
            <li>Trying something</li><p>This is how I usually start, guns blazing straight into the code. It may not always work out (infact it very rarely works out first go) but it makes me feel like I'm making progress in the beginning.</p>
            <li>Rubber ducky method</li><p>Haven't tried it yet, but it seems like my kind of method. Talking to inanimate objects is healthy, right.....right?</p>
            <li>Reading error messages</li><p>This I'm sure will be more useful down the track as I learn what they all mean. Currently this goes hand in hand with google.</p>
            <li>Console.logging</li><p>Unless there's been a console window in a tak we're doing eg:FreeCodeCamp, then I haven't tried or really had a use for this method...yet.</p>
            <li>Googling</li><p>My No.1 go to fix it girl. What would I do without her?!</p>
            <li>Asking your peers for help</li><p>I've more tried to help others rather than asking for help. I'm shocking at asking for help it seems like I'm waisting their time but I know logically I'm not so I need to suck it up sometimes and just do it.</p>
            <li>Asking coaches for help</li><p>Same lines as asking peers for help. Just do it!</p>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection</li><p>Getting better at this week by week, reflection isn't something I've really done in the past so my reflecting skills aren't as shiney as they could be.</p>
          </ul> 
          <h4>What do these mean?</h4>
          <p>.map() - takes an array and for each element it applies a function, it then creates and returns a new array of the post-function elements. For example if you had an array of [3, 4, 6] and a function that tripled the input .map() would spit out [9, 12, 18].</p>
          <p>.filter() - sieves out the elements of an array that don't meet a certain condition/s and returns only the elements that do. For example if you had an array of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and had a condition that only wanted even numbers .filter() would return [2, 4, 6].</p>
          <p>.reduce() - takes four inputs (previousValue/intialValue, currentValue, currentIndex and array) and from my understanding is used predominantly to find the sum of an array.</p>
