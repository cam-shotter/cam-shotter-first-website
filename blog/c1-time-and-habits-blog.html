  <h1>Thoughts on Productivity</h1>
    
    <p>
    I've heard about the pomodoro technique before and tried that again. I like the idea of creating short bursts of productive energy but find that sometimes I get in the zone and want to continue way past the allotted time limit. I have found that this technique combined with a quick meditation works well when I had little or no creative energy, and kind of reset my mind.

    I'm chronic for starting a task, getting halfway through it, then starting another. One thing I have tried to do is skim through all tasks first as an initial overview, then group anything similar together. If I want to start something new partway through then it has to be from a similar task, that way it keeps my mind on track.

    Lastly, I try to make my workspace as comfortable as possible without any massive distractions so I actually like my work environment and want to spend time here.

    I love the incredible variety of productivity, time management and habit building techniques but it's almost like there's too much of a good thing, like an overload of information. But I find it interesting how essential the concept is to good workflow.
