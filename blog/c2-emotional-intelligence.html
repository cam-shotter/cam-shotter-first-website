        <h2>Paying Attention to Attention Paying</h2> 

        <br>

        <p>
          <h3>After watching chapter 1 of Search Inside Yourself, what did I learn?</h3><br>
          I have often thought of myself as a calm person. I'm slow to anger and try to appreciate to little things when life gets tough.
          However, there is still much to learn before I can be considered "mindful".<br>
          I learned that Emotional Intelligence (EQ) can be thought of as both Intrapersonal and Interpersonal, or Self and Others. In turn, Intrapersonal is comprised of Self-Awareness, Self-Regulation and Motivation, while Interpersonal involves Empathy and Social Skills.<br>
          I learned that EQ and IQ are both incredibly important areas to develop in order to be successful, well rounded human who knows how to person good. In several studies EQ was generally thought of as more important than IQ (esspecially for leadership roles).<br>
          I learned that even in adults, Neuroplasticity is still very real. In fact as little as 100 minutes of practicing mindfulness can have a noticable effect on the control of emotional reaction to negative stimulus. The most important aspect of mindfulness it seems, is simply paying attention, with purpose.<br>
          I learned that by being purposefully aware of one's own body and it's various sensations, one can learn to recognise feelings and emotions while they are arising and control their response before it gets out of hand.<br>
          And lastly, I learned that Gut Feelings are caused by an primative part of the brain that is literally connected to the gut but not to any vocal centres which explains why you have intuitive feelings that are incredibly hard to describe.

          <h3>How did I find my two minutes of mindfulness?</h3><br>
          In short, relaxing. There's a certain calmness that stems from deep introspection, like a massage for your soul. I find I'm less fidgety and able to think clearer.
