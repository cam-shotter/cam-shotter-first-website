          <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
          <br>
          <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>
          <p>Focusing on process forced me to nut out vital parts of the site before even touching a computer. I completely overhauled my site and feel like it now has more purpose than before.
          I'm naturally a disorganised person and don't go for a process approach usually (although it's something I've been told to do many times before), however I am aware that mistakes and oversights are much more common when no process is followed and have personally suffered many times because of this. So if I'm able to master this skill it is something that will increase my productivity and end results greatly.</p>
          <h4>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</h4>
          <p>I've always been open to meditation and have attempted it many times with various degrees of success. It has helped me through difficult times of my life and assisted with putting several things in perspective.</p>
          <h4>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h4>
          <p>The main thing I took away from chapter 2 was that it's okay to "fail" at meditation because even failure trains your "meditation muscle" and you will eventually get better.
          I also discovered that there's no correct way to sit, and that whatever position makes you feel relaxed but alert, or like a mountain, or a stream......or a butterfly in the breeze, is the best for you.
          Breathe as though your life depends on it.</p>
          <h4>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
          <p>It's funny (at least to me) that in order to be free, to unleash our default state of happiness, we have to practice. That there's a technique to being natural and to knowing oneself is hilarious.</p>
