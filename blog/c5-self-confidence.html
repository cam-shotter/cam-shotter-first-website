          <h3>From Compulsion to Choice</h3>
          <br>
          <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
          <p>Comparing quotes from Daniel Goleman and Jon Kabat-Zinn it appears that both mindfulness and self awareness are two sides of the same coin. Thinking about this it makes sense. Mindfulness is all about paying attention or being purposefully aware (particularly to the self), which means they are totally intertwined and one cannot exist without the other.</p>
          <h4>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>
          <p>I decided to try a Body Scan. 15 minutes, uninterrupted self-focus time, beginning at my head and working my way down each major body part until I reached my toes. Sounds easy, right!? 
          Well in some ways it is. It's relaxing, calming, tranquil almost...that is until you realize you're reigning in your mind for the 20th time and you're barely past your nose.
          I don't know why, but I found this exercise the hardest one so far. Every body part I focussed on seemed to develop a lingering itch and due to an unshakable blocked nose I was acutely aware of every, raspy breath (breaking through a nostrel straw can't be good for concentration). However, despite all these minor setbacks, when I finally got into the rhythm of it I did manage to get a small understanding of how each part of my body was feeling. Eventually I was able to pin-point exactly where my sore or stiff muscle was and with slightly snotty deep breathing let go of the stress.
          At the end I felt measurably more relaxed, and didn't particularly feel like moving for a long while.</p>
          <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h4>
          <p>Too often I'll be out with a few friends, having a couple of drinks or in town. It'll be late and inexplicably someone would have had one too many. Usually they're nice, friendly people who recognise situations and are able to control their emotional responses. However too often when they're out of mind they will let their emotions control them instead. I know in these instances it isn't my friend who is reacting this way, it's his emotions and his inhibited control over them. I feel that this is an all too common real life comparison with the concept of "My Emotion are Not Me".</p>
