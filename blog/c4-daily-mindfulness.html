          <h3>Meditation Beyond the Yoga Mat</h3>
          <br>
          <h4>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>
          <p>The person I chose to have a "mindful conversation" with was my sister. She loves talking and has naturally great EQ so seemed like the perfect "experimental subject". We started off with her talking and me listening. I found the 3 minutes of uninterrupted listening fairly hard purely because questions naturally come up and it's difficult not to ask them or form a discussion. She definitely enjoyed free reign of my attention and appreciated being listened to.
          When it was my turn to talk I couldn't think of much to say. I find too much attention off-putting and start to second guess the way I'm saying things.
          We both thought it was a useful exercise and would be a great way to resolve conflict but has it's awkward points if you're not totally comfortable with the environment or other person.</p>
          <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
          <p>I really like the idea of mindful walking. Walking in general is relaxing and already a well known way to clear your head, so it makes sense that being mindful of each step would accentuate the whole process.
          I also love eating and often take food for granted (sorry food, I love and appreciate you really), so pretending each meal is an expensive, fancy, rare meal seems like it would fit well with me.</p>
