          <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
          <br>
          <h4>What is a responsive site, and why is responsiveness important?</h4>
          <p>A responsive website is one that can adapt it's layout and change it's elements to suit the screen it is being viewed on.</p>

          <h4>What is mobile first design, and why is it important?</h4>
          <p>Because the world is becoming more connected and increasingly mobile, phones and tablets are quickly becoming the main devices for browsing the internet. This means it's beneficial to design a responsive website for x-small (or mobile) screens first, and adapt them for small, medium, large and x-large screens after.
          Mobile first design is taking this approach when going through the design process.</p>

          <h4>What are frameworks, and what are their pros and cons?</h4>
          <p>A framework is a pre-written set of css code. It is an easy way to make a website look and feel nice without having to write all the code yourself.
          There are several frameworks that others have already written so there is plenty of choice with layouts and design. Some offer a full range of pre-coded options eg: buttons, tables, modals, links, navbars, image carousels etc, while others only offer a few.
          While it may seem better to use a framework that has all the options, there are also benefits in using a more specific, streamlined framework; such as faster loading times and more intimate knowledge of the code and what it's capable of.
          While frameworks are a nice, easy, lazy way to code they aren't perfect, and often still need tweaking to look and behave exactly how you want.</p>

          <h4>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</h4>
          <p>Imaginge looking at this website (or any website) and trying to recreate it using only chicken wire. You could outline everything and show where stuff goes and how it relates to the rest of the page, but not much more. Wireframing is drawing (hand or using an app) your website as if it's made of chicken wire, basic and without any extra design distractions. It's a great step in the design process and allows you as the designer to get a good feel for how the site will flow and feel to the user.
          </p>
          <div>
          <h5>Below are some examples of the wireframes used to design this website</h5>
          <h6>Index.html Mobile View<img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="Index Mobile"></h6>
          <h6>Index.html Desktop View<img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="Index Desktop"></h6>
          <h6>Blog Archives Desktop View<img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-blog-archives-desktop.jpg" alt="Blog Archives"></h6>
          <h6>Blog Template Mobile View<img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" alt="Blog Mobile"></h6>
          <h6>Blog Template Desktop View<img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="Blog Desktop"></h6>
          </div>

          <h4>What aspects of my wireframes did I find difficult to implement, and why?</h4>
          <p>I tried to be extra clever and put in tiles for my favourite posts and projects that would automatically rearrange and resize with the screen size......however my design eyes were bigger than my developer stomach and I am still struggling to figure that one out.</p>
