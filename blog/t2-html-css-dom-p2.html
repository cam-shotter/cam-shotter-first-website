        <p>
          <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
          <br>
          Mixing words around, it's a type of web page design based upon a grid system of rows and columns. It's common practice to use 12 equal columns as 12 can be divided equally between 2, 3 and 4 allowing multiple different page designs.

          <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
          <br>
          More and more internet users are viewing the web through phones and tablets. Responsive design is all about ensuring a good viewing experience for everyone, regardless of which device or screen size they view it from.

          <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
          <br>
          It's the logical structuring of html code, ie: using h1 tags for important headings and img tags for images
          It goes hand in hand with good coding practice and ensures clean, SEO orientated code that is logical to read and follow for other developers.
