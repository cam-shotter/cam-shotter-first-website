        <h2>Technical Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend? <br>
          There's a video on Udacity which explains HTML, CSS and Javascript as a house with the DOM being a graphical representation of how it's all linked. Since this analogy is so good I'll recycle it here.
          Think of HTML as the structure of a house, the walls, the floor, the kitchen, the bathroom, the attic etc. Now imagine CSS is the designer coming in and making it look great. Rearranging the furniture, painting the walls, picking out which benchtop goes best. Without CSS the house would just be exposed raw materials put in the right spots, now it's a good looking, feature-rich home.
          Javascript can be thought of as a family coming to live in the house. Pulling the curtains every night, turning the TV on and off, switching light switches and running taps. They're there changing things as they go.
          The DOM can be thought of as the architectural plans. Overall they show a property, within the property is a house, a front yard and a back yard, within the back yard is a shed and within the house is several floors which all contain several rooms.

          What is meant by boxifying design? <br>
          At it's most basic level every website in existence is made up of a bunch of boxes arranged in creative ways. Boxifying a design is splitting a website into these boxes to figure out the order in which it's put/going to be put together.

        <p>
          What is the box model? <br>
          Each box is made up of a few components. There's the content, padding, border and margin. This is the box model and mainpulating these components allows huge customisation and creative design of a web page.
